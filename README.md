# Advanced Lane Finding

[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

## Overview
The goal of this project is to use OpenCV to build
a pipeline for lane finding. The performance of our pipeline
is checked by applying it to some images and videos.

## Contents of Repository
The followings are the contents of this repository
(see also the repository for this project by Udacity
[here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines)):

- `project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for lane finding.
- `project.html`: Html export of the above Jupyter Notebook.
- `writeup.md`: this markdown summarizes how we built the pipeline and checked
its performance in `project.ipynb`.
- `camera_cal`: this folder contains the images of chess boards used for the camera calibration.
- `output_images`: this folder contains the images used in `writeup.md`.
- `test_images`: this folder contains the images used in the course of building our pipeline.
- `videos`: this folder contains the videos with the lanes detected by applying our pipeline.

The original videos used for the lane finding are available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6xbvixa04hmitzj/project_video.mp4?dl=0)
